# What is "ein Bisschen Deutsch" bot?
This bot is what I created for those of us who are trying to learn Deutsch but find Artikels and verbs hard to study, Basically you can ask this bot a German ward and what you receive is the artikel of that word, or you can ask an English word and despiteful help you to find the German meaning for it.
Beside that , this bot will automatically ask you the artikle of the words, based on what you asked previously what some stranger asked on the pot or what your classmates asked this bot.
also you can level the wards based on what level you are.

some features are not available now but will be available in the future
